<h1>Project Wayfarer</h1>
<p>Wayfarer is a web application where people can share tips about their travel locations around the world. It builds a community for people seeking to travel or craving to learn about the art and architectures around the world. Users can share their travel tips and highlights by creating a post for the countries listed in the app. Users also have their own profile page, which shows their information and their history of posts in descending order. Users are also able to edit their name and their current city in their profiles.</p>

<p>We created this website in sprints. Each sprint is broken down by major functionalities. We also pair-programmed to tackle complex issues together. We discussed code and practiced using technical terminology. We communicated on design and dissected each sprint into technical milestones to track our progress as a team.</p>
